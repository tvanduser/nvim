My neovim setup to run natively on windows.

I made this becuase I think it's cool and I want to say I use VIM btw.

still working on it... it is really only good for editing C and lua rn.

**shortcuts**
anything other than the vim default shortcuts are in remaps.lua
!there are some in lsp.lua for when it comes to using the autocompleted suggestions

**In Progress**
currently have a bug saying that I can't resource my config since i am requiring it in two places

eventually I want to make the startup a little better
